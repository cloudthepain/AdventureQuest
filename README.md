# Adventure Quest 2021

Welcome to Captain Coder’s Adventure Quest! This site will help guide you through learning how to create a Point and Click adventure game in Unity that is inspired by classic Table Top Role Playing Games such as Dungeons & Dragons, Swords & Sorcery, and Fate Core!

This project is focused heavily on teaching you how to manage the complexity of large(ish) programs written with C# and Unity. More specifically, this project focuses on:

* Object Oriented Design Principles in C#
* Unit Testing with Unity Test Framework
* Unity’s User Interface Framework
